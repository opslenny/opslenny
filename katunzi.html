    <p>I like learning HTML!</p>

    <p>
        <b>Speech:</b><em>"Why I Love Learning HTML and CSS"</em>
    </p>

    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<br>
    <p>Today, I want to share something that genuinely excites me—learning HTML and CSS.

        At first, HTML and CSS might sound like just a bunch of strange tags and curly braces.
        But once you dive in, you realize you are learning the language of the web.
        HTML gives structure to everything we see online—from simple blogs to complex apps—while CSS
        brings those structures to life with colors, layouts, and animations.
    </p>
    What I really love about HTML and CSS is how creative and logical they are at the same time.
    It is like building with digital Lego.
    You decide what goes where, how it looks, and how users interact with it.
    One moment you are adding a headline, and the next you are styling buttons to
    change color when someone hovers over them—it is so satisfying!

    <p>I also appreciate how accessible it is.
        All you need is a text editor and a browser to get started.
        There is no pressure—just experiment, refresh, and see what happens.
        And when it works, it feels like magic.
    
        But beyond the fun, HTML and CSS are powerful tools.
    </p>
    <p> They are the foundation of web development.
        Every modern website starts here.
        Knowing these languages opens doors to more advanced skills like JavaScript,
        responsive design, and even careers in tech.

        So, whether you are into design, problem-solving, or just love making things,
        HTML and CSS are amazing skills to learn.
        They have definitely sparked my passion for web development, and I can't wait to keep building.
